## Process

The refactoring process included taking a group of classes and changing them all to the same single class due to the styles in CSS being identical. Alt was added to the images for accessibility. The order of the elements were changed to be in a logical order. The div elements were changed to semantic elements. The title was changed to Horiseon, the name of the site.
